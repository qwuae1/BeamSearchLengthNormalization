lambda influence the length of the sentence
score=logP/y^λ  and P<1
so score <0 and when λ increases, the score will be higher compared to score=logP, so the length is more likely to be longer.
when λ is small, the result is same. While λ increased larger than 1, the result is quite different than.

when λ=1.5 the result is like
-5.83196914992102		<s> It is expected . </s>
-0.3595095222518627	<s> It is expected to the United States . </s>

Play with prewords,I found only the last words matter. By using the same last word, I got same result.
Which is flaw for this method. Some improvements needs
-5.83196914992102		<s> Water is expected . </s>
-0.3595095222518627	<s> Water is expected to the United States . </s>

I also tried to play with the beamK, it is better within 10-100 the searched value will be around 1000 to 10000.
If it beamK is larger ,more possibilities will be explored.But more memory and time is required.
